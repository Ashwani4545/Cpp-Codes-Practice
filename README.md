Prerequisites

To run these programs, you need:

C++ Compiler: g++ or any IDE like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, CLion.

Basic knowledge of C++ syntax is recommended for understanding the code.

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Ashwani4545/cpp-practice.git


Navigate to the folder containing the program you want to run:

cd cpp-practice/basics


Compile the C++ program:

g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name


Run the compiled program:

./program_name


Tip: Many programs contain input prompts, so follow the instructions displayed in the console.

Topics Covered

Basics: Variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions

OOP: Classes, objects, constructors, destructors, inheritance, polymorphism

Data Structures: Arrays, strings, vectors, stacks, queues, maps, sets

Algorithms: Sorting (bubble, merge, quick), searching (linear, binary), recursion, dynamic programming

File Handling: Reading and writing files, file streams

Advanced: Templates, pointers, smart pointers, exception handling, operator overloading
